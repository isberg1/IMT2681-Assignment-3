# this breaks building from PRs because go get over-writes checkout out
# code with the code from master branch
# we don't have any dependencies so no need to fetch them
# If we did, we can fetch them manually or do some magic with go list ./... | grep filter | xargs go get -u
#before_install:
#    - go get -d -t -v ./...
